# DoorToRoad
Description :

Sustainability in nutshell means coexistence of humans, animals and environment ,what better way to coexist serving self and others in one go and saving environment from wastage. This idea took birth in pandemic when we saw abundance of food leftover and vegetable/fruits peel offs/skin in every household as consumption was at a higher rate due to the need to keep immunity high .On the other hand there were scarcity for animals and needy as there was no bridge to share. Also there is lack of awareness and resources to keep this chain functional. With this idea of Door to Road we are trying to build a culture of  sharing . Building a network of people who are willing to share and those who are in need of those items.
